# Product Vision

## Vision Statement

**Last Pitch** is the summer’s grand finale — the day when a backyard turns into a big-league stadium, friendships become rivalries, and every swing could be the season’s last home run.

It’s the app that takes a single day of neighborhood ball and makes it unforgettable. From registration and team drafts to live scoring and post-game recaps, Last Pitch captures the fun, the drama, and the heart of the game.

Built for kids chasing one more chance at glory and the parents who make the magic happen, Last Pitch helps turn casual play into a tradition the whole community waits for.

## Why It Matters

Other tools are built for leagues and logistics. Last Pitch is for something different — the one-day backyard showdowns that feel bigger than life. This isn’t about standings or trophies. It’s about community, laughter, and sending summer off in style.

## Product Principles

**1. Feel Big League**
Make it look and feel like the pros — even if the bases are spray-painted in the grass.

**2. Capture the Moment**
Build every feature to preserve the day’s magic through highlights, recaps, and stories worth retelling.

**3. Embrace the Chaos**
Backyard ball is unpredictable. Lean into the quirks and keep it fun.

No ads. No paywalls. Win hearts before wallets.

If you want, I can also give you a **one-page “pitch deck version”** of this so you can use it to recruit early users, partners, or potential sponsors. That format would really pop for this concept.
