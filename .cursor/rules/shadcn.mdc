### Components
- Prefer Shadcn primitives (Button, Input, Dialog, DropdownMenu) and compose.
- Keep components small and focused; lift state out when reusable.
- Use `cva` for variants; keep names consistent (size, variant, state).

### Styling
- Tailwind for layout/spacing; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Keep class lists readable; extract with `cn()` helper when too long.

### Accessibility
- Provide labels for all inputs and controls.
- Manage focus on dialogs/menus; ensure keyboard navigation works.
- Use semantic HTML; avoid div soup.

### Theming
- Support light/dark via CSS vars. Donâ€™t hardcode colors; use tokens.

### Forms
- Use Zod + `react-hook-form` with Shadcn inputs where forms are non-trivial.
